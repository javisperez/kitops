# Installing KitOps
`kit` is the command-line tool for building and managing [KitOps ModelKits](https://kitops.org/).

Although you downloaded KitOps, you can install with Homebrew if preferred by tapping `kitops-ml/kitops` and using `brew install kitops`.

## MacOS

Move the `kit` executable to `/usr/local/bin`

After install, open a new terminal and run `kit version`. If Kit is installed correctly, you'll see a kit version printed.

## Windows

Move `kit.exe` to a folder in your system `PATH` ([Finding and editing your PATH](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/))

After install, open a new terminal and run `kit version`. If Kit is installed correctly, you'll see a kit version printed.

## Linux

```shell
tar -xzvf kitops-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
sudo mv kit /usr/local/bin/
```

After install, open a new terminal and run `kit version`. If Kit is installed correctly, you'll see a kit version printed.
