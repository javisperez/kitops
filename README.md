### What is KitOps?

KitOps is a packaging, versioning, and sharing system for AI/ML projects that uses open standards so it works with the AI/ML, development, and DevOps tools you are already using, and can be stored in your enterprise container registry. It's AI/ML platform engineering teams' preferred solution for securely packaging and versioning assets.

KitOps creates a ModelKit for your AI/ML project which includes everything you need to reproduce it locally or deploy it into production. You can even **selectively unpack a ModelKit** so different team members can save time and storage space by only grabbing what they need for a task. Because ModelKits are immutable, signable, and live in your existing container registry they're easy for organizations to track, control, and audit.

ModelKits [simplify the handoffs between data scientists, application developers, and SREs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2qjHf2HzSQ) working with LLMs and other AI/ML models. Teams and enterprises use KitOps as a secure storage throughout the AI/ML project lifecycle.

Use KitOps to speed up and de-risk all types of AI/ML projects:
* Predictive models
* Large language models
* Computer vision models
* Multi-modal models
* Audio models
* etc...

### 🇪🇺 EU AI Act Compliance 🔒
For our friends in the EU - ModelKits are the perfect way to create a library of model versions for EU AI Act compliance because they're tamper-proof, signable, and auditable.


### 😍 What's New? ✨

* 🚢 Create a **[runnable container from a ModelKit](https://tinyurl.com/5b76p5u3)** with one command! Read [KitOps deploy docs](https://kitops.org/docs/deploy/) for details.
* 🥂 Get the most out of KitOps' ModelKits by using them with the **[Jozu Hub](https://jozu.ml/)** repository. Or, continue using ModelKits with your existing OCI registry (even on-premises and air-gapped).
* 🛠️ Use KitOps with Dagger pipelines using our modules from the [Daggerverse](https://github.com/kitops-ml/daggerverse).
* ⛑️ [KitOps works great with Red Hat](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/09/16/enhance-llms-instructlab-kitops) InstructLab and Quay.io products.


### Features

* 🎁 **[Unified packaging](https://kitops.org/docs/modelkit/intro/):** A ModelKit package includes models, datasets, configurations, and code. Add as much or as little as your project needs.
* 🏭 **[Versioning](https://kitops.org/docs/cli/cli-reference/#kit-tag):** Each ModelKit is tagged so everyone knows which dataset and model work together.
* 🔒 **[Tamper-proofing](https://kitops.org/docs/modelkit/spec/):** Each ModelKit package includes an SHA digest for itself, and every artifact it holds.
* 🤩 **[Selective-unpacking](https://kitops.org/docs/cli/cli-reference/#kit-unpack):** Unpack only what you need from a ModelKit with the `kit unpack --filter` command - just the model, just the dataset and code, or any other combination.
* 🤖 **[Automation](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-kit-cli):** Pack or unpack a ModelKit locally or as part of your CI/CD workflow for testing, integration, or deployment (e.g. [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-kit-cli) or [Dagger](https://github.com/kitops-ml/daggerverse).
* 🐳 **[Deploy containers](https://kitops.org/docs/deploy/):** Generate a basic or custom docker container from any ModelKit.
* 🚢 **[Kubernetes-ready](https://kitops.org/docs/deploy/):** Generate a Kubernetes / KServe deployment config from any ModelKit.
* 🪛 **[LLM fine-tuning](https://dev.to/kitops/fine-tune-your-first-large-language-model-llm-with-lora-llamacpp-and-kitops-in-5-easy-steps-1g7f):** Use KitOps to fine-tune a large language model using LoRA.
* 🎯 **[RAG pipelines](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5384392/A-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Building-and-Distributing):** Create a RAG pipeline for tailoring an LLM with KitOps.
* 📝 **[Artifact signing](https://kitops.org/docs/next-steps/):** ModelKits and their assets can be signed so you can be confident of their provenance.
* 🌈 **[Standards-based](https://kitops.org/docs/modelkit/compatibility/):** Store ModelKits in any OCI 1.1-compliant container or artifact registry.
* 🥧 **[Simple syntax](https://kitops.org/docs/kitfile/kf-overview/):** Kitfiles are easy to write and read, using a familiar YAML syntax.
* 🩰 **[Flexible](https://kitops.org/docs/kitfile/format/#model):** Reference base models using `model parts`, or store key-value pairs (or any YAML-compatible JSON data) in your Kitfile - use it to keep features, hyperparameters, links to MLOps tool experiments, or validation output.
* 🏃‍♂️‍➡️ **[Run locally](./docs/src/docs/deploy.md#running-llms-locally):** Kit's Dev Mode lets you run an LLM locally, configure it, and prompt/chat with it instantly.
* 🤗 **Universal:** ModelKits can be used with any AI, ML, or LLM project - even multi-modal models.

## 🚀 Try KitOps in under 15 Minutes

1. [Install the CLI](https://kitops.org/docs/cli/installation/) for your platform.
2. Follow the [Getting Started](https://kitops.org/docs/get-started/) docs to learn to pack, unpack, and share a ModelKit.
3. Test drive one of our [ModelKit Quick Starts](https://jozu.ml/organization/jozu-quickstarts) that includes everything you need to run your model including a codebase, dataset, documentation, and of course the model.

For those who prefer to build from the source, follow [these steps](https://kitops.org/docs/cli/installation/#🛠️-install-from-source) to get the latest version from our repository.

## What is in the box?

**[ModelKit](https://kitops.org/docs/modelkit/intro/):** At the heart of KitOps is the ModelKit, an OCI-compliant packaging format for sharing all AI project artifacts: datasets, code, configurations, and models. By standardizing the way these components are packaged, versioned, and shared, ModelKits facilitate a more streamlined and collaborative development process that is compatible with any MLOps or DevOps tool.

**[Kitfile](https://kitops.org/docs/kitfile/kf-overview/):** A ModelKit is defined by a Kitfile - your AI/ML project's blueprint. It uses YAML to describe where to find each of the artifacts that will be packaged into the ModelKit. The Kitfile outlines what each part of the project is.

**[Kit CLI](https://kitops.org/docs/cli/cli-reference/):** The Kit CLI not only enables users to create, manage, run, and deploy ModelKits -- it lets you pull only the pieces you need. Just need the serialized model for deployment? Use `unpack --model`, or maybe you just want the training datasets? `unpack --datasets`.
